# Personal Budget

### Project Description:

This is a project as part of the Codecademy back-end engineering course. It was designed to test knowledge and practice the implementation of Node.js, Express, and Javascript. 

### General:

This project was relatively difficult and probably took me longer than it should have. Google became my best friend frequently, as I worked around problems I discovered.

Is the code clean and/or perfect? Absolutely not. But it works, and that is a good first step as I work through the Codecademy course and slowly melt my brain.

My intention is to come back to this project (or build it again) as I advance and get a better understanding of writing cleaner, better code.

### Features:

Personal budget can be used to set up and track monthly expenditure. Starting with your monthly expenditure limit, you can creat different categories (eg. Groceries, Rent etc.) You can then divide up your overall budget into the categories. From there, as you add individual expenses day-to-day, the application will track your expenditure and give you an insight into your spending, showing if you remain within your budget target or have used more than your assigned budget.

### How to use:

The page can be viewed using the HTML index file after running npm run devstart in terminal.

You can set your monthly income (overall budget) using 'set income'.

Once you have an income set, you can add / edit the categories with the button at the bottom of the page, or from the menu at the top. Setting the starting budget on each category subtracts the starting category from your monthly income, letting you know if you have gone over your monthly income. Monthly income will turn red if this happens.

Once you have your categories set up and their starting budgets picked, you can add individual expenses using 'My expenses'. These will be divided into your chosen category and the category will then display your remaining budget. You can also view and edit the expenses for each category.

An overspend in any category will result in said category turning red.

### Technologies:

Basic use of HTML to structure the page. CSS was used for styling. Javascript, Node.js, and Express to create functionality.

### Licence

Open.
